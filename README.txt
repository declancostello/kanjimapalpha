This is a project to accomplish a few beginner's tasks.

Use virtualenv to work on code locally
Check in code to GitHub
Create a simple application, based on the django tutorial which has a CRUD interface for Japanese sentences.

Later I'll work on getting it running on the free tier of Amazon AWS.
